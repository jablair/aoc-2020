# Advent of Code 2020

Mucking around with this in a Playground.

**Update**: Turns out doing this in a Playground wasn't a great idea - the overhead makes it _really_ slow, sometimes to the point of beachballing Xcode. Much better to do this in a standalone executable. Since I started down this path, I'm going to keep updating the playground, but I don't recommend running it in this environment.

Building and running in Xcode 12.3.
